a) adding and committing files:
   33  git add second_file.txt
   34  git commit -m "Add second file to project"
   35  git log
   36  git status

Alternatief, 
	git commit -a

b) see difference between current working directory and staging three:
   53  git diff (--color-words)

c) see difference between staged directory and commited:
   54  git diff --staged

d) Delete files:
	- optie 1:
<manually delete file_to_delete1.txt in the folder>
   66  git rm file_to_delete1.txt
   67  git status
   68  git commit -m "Delete first file"
	
	- optie 2: (permanently delete the file)
   70  git rm file_to_delete2.txt
   71  git status
   73  git commit -m "Delete second file"

e) Move and rename files
	- optie 1: 
<manually renamed first_file to primary_file>
   78  git add primary_file.txt
   79  git rm first_file.txt
(-> it sees that files are the same/very similar and it detects that it must be a rename

	-  optie 2: kunnen we ook gebruiken om file naar map <folder> te brengen
   82  git mv second_file.txt <folder>/secondary_file.txt
   83  git status
